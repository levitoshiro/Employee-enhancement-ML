Enhance Employee Productivity using Talent Analytics and Visualization
🚀 This project is dedicated to boosting employee productivity through the strategic application of talent analytics and visualization techniques. Harnessing the power of diverse machine learning models, the aim is to predict targeted productivity based on a spectrum of features indicative of employee performance. 🤖

The journey begins with the importation of essential libraries, a peep into the Kaggle input directory, and the subsequent loading of the dataset from a CSV file. A comprehensive exploration of the data unfolds, revealing the initial rows, dataset info, descriptive stats, column names, and any missing values. Addressing data gaps, the 'wip' column is filled with the mean value, ensuring a robust dataset for subsequent analysis.

Visual storytelling takes center stage with a histogram capturing the essence of the 'actual_productivity' column. The correlation matrix adds a splash of color to the narrative through a heatmap, offering a visual feast of feature relationships. 📊 This visual exploration sets the stage for subsequent data preprocessing steps.

The dataset undergoes a makeover, extracting feature correlations with the target variable ('targeted_productivity'). Features and target variables embark on separate journeys, and the dataset splits into training and testing sets, laying the groundwork for model evaluation.

🤖 The ensemble of machine learning models includes the Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, AdaBoost Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. Enter hyperparameter tuning, featuring grid searches and randomized quests for optimization. The R2 score takes center stage, donning the hat of the chief evaluator for each model's predictive prowess.

In conclusion, this project is more than just code—it's a systematic guide to elevating employee productivity. By integrating talent analytics, visualization, and machine learning, organizations can unlock valuable insights into employee performance, shaping informed decisions for a more productive work environment. 🌟 The well-documented and structured code serves as a treasure map for organizations eager to embark on similar predictive analytics adventures. 🗺️
